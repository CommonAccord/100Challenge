Ti=Criteria

0.sec=We will ask them to determine whether projects are impactful, evidence-based, feasible, and durable.

Impactful.sec=Impactful is the goal of the competition. Does the proposal describe the urgent problem worth solving, and will the solution have a transformative impact?

Evidence.sec=The second criteria is evidence-based. We want to know, will the solution work? Does the proposal present evidence that the solution or critical components of it have previously yielded practical and concrete results? This is not a competition to test a new idea or theory. Does the evidence suggest that the solution can be adapted to other contexts, such as expanding to new populations or geographies, or to reach a greater number of people over time, and still retain its effectiveness?

Feasible.sec=The third criteria is feasible. When it comes to feasibility, the kinds of questions we want peers and wise heads to consider are: Does the team have the skills, capacity, relationships, and experience to deliver its proposal?

Durable.sec=The last criteria, durable, is the one that sets 100&Change apart. If we were focused on solving a problem, we want the $100 million solution to have a sustained impact.
