1.sec=For us, legal codification would be like voting:  a mechanism to enable people to participate collectively in their own governance.  

2.sec=If legal institutions become too remote in terms of influence, comprehension, or money, then people may come to look at it as just an instrument of power.  It loses legitimacy and loyalty by those who are governed legallyâ€”and then begins a downward spiral in which it must indeed start relying more on power.  Because at some point that is all it will have left.  

3.sec=So maybe MacArthur can be convinced of the deep long-term significance.
