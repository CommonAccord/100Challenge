<p>This is a place for discussion and proposals relating to a fully-funded approach to crowd-source legal codification.  The goal is to put the methods of legal collaboration into the hands of everyone, to promote conversation of current practices to collaborative methods, and to enable underserved communities to participate fully.</p>

<p>The format of the discussion is as a response to the MacArthur Foundation "100 Challenge" -   <a href="https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/">https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, we have only a stub: the Challenge criteria.
